# MovieApplication

The purpose of the online movie management system is to ease movie management and to create a convenient and easy-to-use application for users, 
trying to search information on different movies. The system is based on the distributed database to manage the user authentication and user 
addition of movies to different lists. We fetch the information of the different movies using the TMDB API.
Above all, we hope to provide a comfortable user experience along with the best service available.
